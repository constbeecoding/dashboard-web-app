# **Web App Dashboard**

## Building a Web App was a challenge, but one that helped solidify everything I've been working on up until this point. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and using SCSS to make my CSS more modular.

## Struggles 
- Combining Grid with Flexbox and "Grid within a Grid" behavior.
- Div Soup. So many divs to accomplish what I wanted.

## Triumphs
- Look at those breakpoints!
- I'm proud of the SVG Moon. The colors eb and flow.
